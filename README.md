OE's Habitat start mod for Stellaris

* Now updated to Stellaris 2.6! Works both with Federations DLC and without. *
* Convert your habitats to Foundry, Industrial, Research, Fortress or Farming arcologies and get Habitat Captain jobs granting empire unity output bonus increasing per habitat owned. *
* This mod provides habitat start since 2.5.1. Federations DLC owners can combine Void Dwellers origin with perks coming from this mod via civic. *
* New empire modifier for Children of the Void civic, granted in the second year of the game:
Void Campaign: Habitat build and cost speed is reduced by 50%. Bonus diminishes by 5% every 5 years and disappears after 50 years. *
* Backwards compatible with 2.5.1 (at least for now). *
* This mod does not overwrite vanilla files and works great with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guilli's Planet Modifiers[/url]. *

Start on a developed research habitat with hydroponics and habitat technologies unlocked. Wait a month for the game to set the habitat up.

If you are using Void Dwellers Origin select Children of the Void civic to enable mod features. Please note that Void Dwellers Origin does not allow gestalt empires (machines and hive minds) but you can choose Habitat start starting system from my mod with any empire and species.

Using new civic "Children of the Void" is optional, but grants access to second stage of Voidborne ascension perk and habitats with specialised districts. Supports all empire and species types. This includes Rogue Servitor, Hive Mind, Syncretic Evolution etc. Does not overwrite vanilla files. Should be compatible with pretty much everything.

- Children of the Void civic. Sets habitat habitability (if you take it at the start). Enables second stage of Voidborne ascension perk and grants access to unique technologies. Orbital Habitats have Captains (or Brain Synapses) who provide Empire unity output modifier which increases per habitat owned.
- Children of the Void does not grant habitat start - you can opt for that in the empire creation menu (or choose Void Dwellers origin if you have Federations DLC).
- Habitat Captains can be "upgraded" via new reserach options (currently only two).
- Second stage of Voidborne ascension perk: Elysian Isles. Works similar to the Arcology perk, except for habitats. Enables conversion into Industrial, Foundry, Industrial, Research, Fortress or Farming Habitat with specialised districts, at the expense of Generator, Mining and Research Districts (note that Machine empires will still be able to build Generator Districts).

How: In the empire creation menu use Habitat start as your starting system or pick Technocracy of Man.

Number and type of starting districts, buildings and technologies varies slightly depending on the empire and species type:

- Habitat start empires are granted Habitat technology.
- Empires with biological pops get Hydroponics technology and two Hydroponics Farms.
- Lithoid empires get Mineral purification technology and one irreplacable Mineral purification plant.
- Machine empires without biological pops get Habitat technology only.
- Owning Lithoids as a secondary species does not grant Mineral purification.

Habitat has:

- At least one habitation district.
- Two or three energy/commercial districts.
- One research district instead of a research lab.
- At most one cultural district instead of unity building.
- One drone storage for machine empires.
- At most one unity building.

Habitat has some Mineral and Alloy deposits which grant Miner jobs and a few alloys, just enough to keep the empire going.

Please report bugs and suggest balance or feature changes.

This (my first) mod is an ongoing project to learn Stellaris modding. Planned features include story campaign and diplomatic events for Human empires, integration with other mods and custom assets.
