OE's Habitat start mod for Stellaris

Start on a developed research habitat with hydroponics and habitat technologies unlocked. Wait a month for the game to set the habitat up.

Does not use civic slot. Supports all empire and species types. This includes Rogue Servitor, Hive Mind and Syncretic Evolution. Has no special habitability traits, modifiers and does not overwrite vanilla files. Should be compatible with pretty much everything.

Not compatible with achievements. Playable in multiplayer.

How: In the empire creation menu use Habitat start as your starting system or pick Technocracy of Man.

Number and type of starting districts, buildings and technologies varies slightly depending on the empire and species type:
- Habitat start empires are granted Habitat technology.
- Empires with biological pops get Hydroponics technology and two Hydroponics Farms.
- Lithoid empires get Mineral purification technology and one irreplacable Mineral purification plant.
- Machine empires without biological pops get Habitat technology only.
- Owning Lithoids as a secondary species does not grant Mineral purification.

Habitat has:
- At least one habitation district.
- Two or three energy/commercial districts.
- One research district instead of a research lab.
- At most one cultural district instead of unity building.
- One drone storage for machine empires.
- At most one unity building.

Habitat has some Mineral and Alloy deposits which grant Miner jobs and a few alloys, just enough to keep the empire going.

Please report bugs and suggest balance or feature changes.

This (my first) mod is an ongoing project to learn Stellaris modding. Planned features include story campaign and diplomatic events for Human empires, integration with other mods and custom assets.
