Fix for habitat failing to spawn (unusual):

Load game in singleplayer, click on homeworld (planet window). Open console:

1. COPY AND PASTE THIS BLOCK OF TEXT:

effect = {
set_planet_flag = research_habitat
set_planet_flag = amaryllian_habitat
clear_blockers = yes
clear_deposits = yes
set_planet_flag = megastructure
set_planet_flag = habitat }

2. PRESS ENTER

3. EXECUTE:
event amaryllian.1

4. SWITCH TO EMPIRE WINDOW (the one with empire leader)

5. Having empire window up, open console window and execute two more events by copying them and pressing enter each time:
event amaryllian.3
event amaryllian.10


6. WAIT UNTIL NEW MONTH, then execute:
effect remove_modifier = amaryllian_unity_0

7. EXECUTE:
effect give_technology = { tech = tech_habitat_1 } give_technology = { tech = tech_hydroponics }

If you are Lithoid use tech_mineral_purification_1 instead of tech_hydroponics .


This should leave you with habitat set up. Unity bonus should pop up next month.
