[*] Works with Federations DLC and without. Just pick Children of the Void civic from the mod, Void Dwellers origin (if you have Federations)  and you are good to go.
[*] Note: this mod provides its own habitat start separate from Federations' Void Dwellers since Stellaris 2.5.1. This legacy habitat start does not require Federations DLC. Formerly known as OE's Habitat start. Use of Void Dwellers or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743133825]Starborn[/url] origin with Children of the Void civic is preferable, though.
[*] Backwards compatible with 2.6.* if you install [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2124541406]Stellaris version checker[/url]. Should also work on 2.5.* but bureaucratic habitat arcologies introduced in 2.6 won't function.
[/list]

[u][b]High compatibility[/b][/u]
This mod does not overwrite vanilla files and as such is compatible with almost anything. Works great with numerous mods.

I highly recommend  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guilli's Planet Modifiers[/url] as it provides many habitat modifiers.

Structures from following mods receive Habitat Captain job and benefit from Elysian Isles Ascension Perk (-25% housing usage):

Additionally, Planetary Habitats can be converted into Arcologies just like normal habitats (full support).
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743133825]Starborn: Improved Voidtouched[/url] ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2034940146]see screenshot[/url]). You can convert into Specialised Habitat Arcology any habitat changed by Starborn mod, except special Starborn starting habitat. This is simply a design desision.

[u][b]Children of the Void civic[/b][/u]
Select in the empire creation menu to enable mod features. Works great with vanilla Void Dwellers or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743133825]Starborn mod[/url] origins.
This civic can be taken and removed at any point of the game via government reform without incurring Habitat habitability.

[u][b]Second stage of Voidborne ascension perk[/b][/u]
Elysian Isles perk improves habitats even further and grants access to powerful but costly Habitat Arcologies.

* [i]Presented cost and upkeep may differ from the actual experience, please consult your governor for empire and planetary modifers.[/i]

[u][b]New technologies[/b][/u]

[u][b]Addon: Void Dwellers trait fix[/b][/u]

Void Dwellers will no longer receive negative trait when settling Ring World or custom habitats from supported mods. This fix requires overwrite of original game file and therefore it is available as a standalone mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2066377400]Void Dwellers traits: Ring World & modded habitats fix[/url]. Habitat Arcologies from Void Dwellers Expanded are vanilla habitats and do not requre this fix but you might want it if you are settling Ring Worlds.

[u][b]Legacy feature: Habitat start which does not requre Federations DLC (read carefully)[/b][/u]

Please note that Void Dwellers Origin does not allow gestalt empires (machines and hive minds) but you can choose Habitat start starting system from my mod with any empire and species. Use Habitat start in the empire creation menu or pick Technocracy of Man. For best experience pick Children of the Void civic. That said, Void Dwellers (Federations DLC required) or Starborn mod (Federations DLC not required) origins are preferred.

Start on a developed research habitat with hydroponics and habitat technologies unlocked. Wait a month for the game to set the habitat up. Supports all empire and species types. This includes Rogue Servitor, Hive Mind, Syncretic Evolution etc.

Children of the Void sets habitat habitability and grants access to 99% of mod features but is not necessarily required if you go with "Habitat start" system. If you forego the civic your species will spawn with habitability as defined in the creation menu.

Number and type of starting districts, buildings and technologies varies slightly depending on the empire and species type.

Habitat has:
[list]
[*]At least one habitation district.
[*]Two or three energy/commercial districts.
[*]One research district instead of a research lab.
[*]At most one cultural district instead of unity building.
[*]One drone storage for machine empires.
[*]At most one unity building.
[/list]

Habitat has some Mineral and Alloy deposits which grant Miner jobs and a few alloys, just enough to keep the empire going.
