Convert your habitats to Foundry, Industrial, Research, Fortress, Bureaucratic, Refinery, Trade, Mining, Generator, Farming, Sanctuary or Storage arcologies.

Habitat Captains (and gestalt equivalent) increase unity output scaling with numbers.

[*] Works with Federations DLC and without. Just pick Children of the Void civic from the mod, Void Dwellers origin (if you have Federations)  and you are good to go.
[*] Note: this mod provides its own habitat start separate from Federations' Void Dwellers since Stellaris 2.5.1. This legacy habitat start does not require Federations DLC. Formerly known as OE's Habitat start. Use of Void Dwellers or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743133825]Starborn[/url] origin with Children of the Void civic is preferable, though.

[u][b]High compatibility[/b][/u]
This mod does not overwrite vanilla files and as such is compatible with almost anything.

I highly recommend  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guilli's Planet Modifiers[/url] as it provides many habitat modifiers.

You can convert into Specialised Habitat Arcology any habitat changed by Starborn mod, except special Starborn starting habitat. This is simply a design desision.

Counts habitable_structure = yes. Inclusion and exclusion planet flags: amaryllian_voidchildren & amaryllian_voidchildren_forbidden .

[u][b]Children of the Void civic[/b][/u]
Select in the empire creation menu to enable mod features. Works great with vanilla Void Dwellers or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743133825]Starborn mod[/url] origins.
This civic can be taken and removed at any point of the game via government reform without incurring Habitat habitability.

[u][b]Legacy feature: Habitat start which does not requre Federations DLC (read carefully)[/b][/u]

Please note that Void Dwellers Origin does not allow gestalt empires (machines and hive minds) but you can choose Habitat start starting system from my mod with any empire and species. Use Habitat start in the empire creation menu or pick Technocracy of Man. For best experience pick Children of the Void civic. That said, Void Dwellers (Federations DLC required) or Starborn mod (Federations DLC not required) origins are preferred.

Start on a developed research habitat with hydroponics and habitat technologies unlocked. Wait a month for the game to set the habitat up. Supports all empire and species types. This includes Rogue Servitor, Hive Mind, Syncretic Evolution etc.

Children of the Void sets habitat habitability and grants access to 99% of mod features but is not necessarily required if you go with "Habitat start" system. If you forego the civic your species will spawn with habitability as defined in the creation menu.

Number and type of starting districts, buildings and technologies varies slightly depending on the empire and species type.

Habitat has some Mineral and Alloy deposits which grant Miner jobs and a few alloys, just enough to keep the empire going.
