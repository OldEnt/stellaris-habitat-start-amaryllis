[*] Works with Federations DLC and without. Just pick Children of the Void civic from the mod, Void Dwellers origin (if you have Federations)  and you are good to go.
[*] Special early game bonus: Habitat build time and cost reduced by 50%. Bonus diminishes by 5% every 5 years and disappears 50 years after start of the game.
[*] Note: this mod provides its own habitat start separate from Federations' Void Dwellers since Stellaris 2.5.1. and is backwards compatible with 2.5.1 (at least for now). This legacy habitat start does not require Federations DLC if you are playing on 2.6.*. Formerly known as OE's Habitat start.

[u][b]High compatibility[/b][/u]
This mod does not overwrite vanilla files and as such is compatible with almost anything. Works great with numerous mods.

I highly recommend  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guilli's Planet Modifiers[/url] as it provides many habitat modifiers.

You can convert into Specialised Habitat Arcology any habitat changed by Starborn mod, except special Starborn starting habitat. This is simply a design desision.

[u][b]Children of the Void civic[/b][/u]
Select in the empire creation menu to enable mod features. Works great with vanilla Void Dwellers or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743133825]Starborn mod[/url] origins.
This civic can be taken and removed at any point of the game via government reform.

[u][b]Addon: Void Dwellers trait fix[/b][/u]

Void Dwellers will no longer receive negative trait when settling Ring World or custom habitats from supported mods. This fix requires overwrite of original game file and therefore it is available as a standalone mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2066377400]Void Dwellers traits: Ring World & modded habitats fix[/url]. Habitat Arcologies from Void Dwellers Expanded are vanilla habitats and do not requre this fix but you might want it if you are settling Ring Worlds.

[u][b]Legacy feature: Habitat start which does not requre Federations DLC (read carefully)[/b][/u]
Please note that Void Dwellers Origin does not allow gestalt empires (machines and hive minds) but you can choose Habitat start starting system (empire creation menu) from my mod with any empire and species. That said, Void Dwellers (Federations DLC required) or Starborn mod (Federations DLC not required) origins are preferred.

For people who do not own Federations DLC or play on 2.5.1.: Start on a developed research habitat with hydroponics and habitat technologies unlocked. Wait a month for the game to set the habitat up. Supports all empire and species types. This includes Rogue Servitor, Hive Mind, Syncretic Evolution etc.

Children of the Void sets habitat habitability and grants access to 99% of mod features but is not necessarily required if you go with "Habitat start" system. If you forego the civic your species will spawn with habitability as defined in the creation menu.

How (non-Void Dwellers, no Federations DLC or Stellaris 2.5.1):

In the empire creation menu use Habitat start as your starting system or pick Technocracy of Man. For best experience pick Children of the Void civic.

Number and type of starting districts, buildings and technologies varies slightly depending on the empire and species type:
[list]
[*]Habitat start empires are granted Habitat technology.
[*]Empires with biological pops get Hydroponics technology and two Hydroponics Farms.
[*]Lithoid empires get Mineral purification technology and one irreplacable Mineral purification plant.
[*]Machine empires without biological pops get Habitat technology only.
[*]Owning Lithoids as a secondary species does not grant Mineral purification.
[/list]

Habitat has:
[list]
[*]At least one habitation district.
[*]Two or three energy/commercial districts.
[*]One research district instead of a research lab.
[*]At most one cultural district instead of unity building.
[*]One drone storage for machine empires.
[*]At most one unity building.
[/list]

Habitat has some Mineral and Alloy deposits which grant Miner jobs and a few alloys, just enough to keep the empire going.

[u][b]Final notes[/b][/u]

Please report bugs and suggest balance or feature changes.

This (my first) mod is an ongoing project to learn Stellaris modding. Planned features include story campaign and diplomatic events for Human empires, integration with other mods and custom assets.
