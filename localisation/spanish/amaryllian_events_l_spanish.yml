amaryllian.999.desc:0 "Fellow player, thank for using my Habitat start mod. Please note that the newest version of this mod introduced a number of features which are inactive in your current playthrough, unless you take new §GChildren of the Void§! civic. You can do that by reforming government in your Empire window.\n\nAmongst new features are: Habitat Captains providing habitat-specific bonuses, second stage of Voidborne ascension perk, and specialised Habitats with £district£ §YIndustrial§!, §YFoundry§!, §YFarming§!, and §YFortress Districts§!.\n\nTaking §GChildren of the Void§! civic during this playthrough will not change your species' habitability. Use §Gfree_government§! console command if you have a timeout on government reform. In the near future choosing this civic will be possible only at the start of the game.\n\nThank you again and see you on the Steam mod page. / OE"
