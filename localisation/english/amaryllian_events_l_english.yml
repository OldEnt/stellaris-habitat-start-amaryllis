Please note that this mod introduced a number of features which are inactive in your current playthrough, unless you take the new §GChildren of the Void§! civic. You can do that by reforming government in your Empire window or restarting the game with the civic.\n\nAmongst new features are: Habitat Captains providing habitat-specific bonuses, second stage of Voidborne ascension perk, and specialised Habitats with £district£ §YIndustrial§!, §YFoundry§!, §YFarming§!, and §YFortress Districts§! (and more).\n\nTaking §GChildren of the Void§! civic during this playthrough will not change your species' habitability.\n\nThank you again and see you on the Steam mod page. / OE"
