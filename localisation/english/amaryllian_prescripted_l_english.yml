 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans_amaryllian_desc:0 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships, carrying a quarter million colonists each, were sent through a recently discovered subspace phenomenon on the outer edge of the Oort Cloud - a small, unstable wormhole. None were heard from again, and the destabilized wormhole vanished.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships, Amaryllis, survived the passage and established a colony on a habitat orbiting a tomb world."
